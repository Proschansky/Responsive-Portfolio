                <p class="text">I'm a web developer with a deep interest in language. 
                I am fluent in German and I have been learning Polish for four years as well. My love of languages
                led me into coding and web development, as I use computer languages to make my websites and interact with my servers. 
                Currently, I am in the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp, where I am learning HTML, CSS and Javascript for front end 
                web development as well as API management. Furthermore, I will be learning Node.js as well as how to deploy Express.js within
                it.</p>
